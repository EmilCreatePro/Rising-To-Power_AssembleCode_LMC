/*
	Explanation: you give two inputs A and B
	and this machine code will give you the result of A^B :)
	
	How it works :- 
	ONE is set to value 1
	REZPU is set to val 1
	ZERO is set to value 0
	REZPR is not used in this context because the result of product is kept in adress 96
	
	Steps:
	-the initial numbers given will be stored in the memory address 99 and 98.
	-we use an auxilliary space of memory(97) to keep track of the value of the first number
	-we load the 0(zero) value and put it in memory 96(we will use this for to determine the product)
	-we the test if the second input is zero, if yes then we output the result(REZPUT)
		otherwise we subtract one from second input and jump to PROD
	-in PROD we load what we have in address 97(the first input), if it's zero then we update the value of REZPU and jump to PUT
		otherwise we load what is in address 96 and add to it REZPU, then store the result in 96 and subtract ONE(1) from 97 and repeat the process
	-when we're DONE we jump to DONE and load the result(REZPU) in address memory 95 and output the result :)
